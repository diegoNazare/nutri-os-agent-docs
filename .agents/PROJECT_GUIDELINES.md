- Always use shadcn/ui components
- Follow established design patterns
- Maintain accessibility standards

### üíª Local Development
**File**: [`LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`](./guidelines/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Always use Supabase local for development
- Follow local setup procedures
- Maintain environment consistency

### üåø Git & Branching
**File**: [`GIT_BRANCHING.md`](./guidelines/GIT_BRANCHING.md)
- All Git operations in English only
- Never commit without explicit user request
- Follow established branching strategy

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
**File**: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./guidelines/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- React + TypeScript + Supabase stack
- Follow component architecture patterns
- Implement proper state management

### üöÄ Production
**File**: [`PRODUCTION.md`](./guidelines/PRODUCTION.md)
- Environment separation strategy
- Security and monitoring guidelines
- Performance optimization standards

## Core Principles

### 1. Consistency
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Maintain code style across the project
- Use consistent naming and structure

### 2. Quality
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow security best practices

### 3. Documentation

### 4. Testing
- Test changes thoroughly before deployment
- Maintain test coverage for critical functionality
- Use local environment for testing

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** for component library
- **React Router** for navigation

### Backend
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- **Row Level Security** for data protection
- **Real-time subscriptions** for live updates

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** for code linting
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Git** for version control
